Assignment 1 - Recursions.

Assignment 2 - Time complexity computation and optimizations.

Assignment 3 - Conway's game of life implementation with user interface and colours (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Run ConwayMain.java.

Game World - simulates a world of herbivores and carnivores and plants, which consume one another according to a complex pattern. Similar to the Game of Life.

Corona Vaccine Booth - a simulation challenge, where customers visit several booths for corona vaccination. The task is to simulate the income of customers via a Poisson process and optmize their booth allocations in order to maximize the number of vaccinated people.
